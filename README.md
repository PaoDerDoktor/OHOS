# OHOS

A simple, very basic (for now) custom kernel and OS project

## Current compilation

This project currently only use a GNU-GCC cross-compiler (i386-elf). I managed to install it thanks to the awesome [DaedalusProject's "Making an OS (x86)" series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLm3B56ql_akNcvH8vvJRYOc7TbYhRs19M)'s. The project was founded on this series and on the [OSDev wiki](https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page).

## Current usage

The project is at this point **ABSOLUTELY NOT** safe to use as a real OS, even on small computers or fun use-cases. It is inteded to run on [qemu](https://www.qemu.org).

## Documentation

For now, documentation is only in the comments of each file. It should soon be fixed.

## Current `test` folder

Current `test` folder at the root of the repository is nothing but short samples of assembly code written in 2 weeks or so that are kept as a "quick cheat sheet".
